# L1 Rocket Embedded Systems Code

This repository contains the embedded software for our L1 rocket, developed using C++ in VS Code with PlatformIO. The code is responsible for interfacing with onboard sensors and managing flight data.

Features & Components:
Microcontroller Integration: Firmware for embedded systems controlling various rocket functions.

Sensor Data Acquisition: Uses the Adafruit BMP280 (barometric pressure sensor) and Adafruit Sensor Library to collect altitude, temperature, and pressure readings.

Flight Monitoring: Captures real-time atmospheric data for telemetry and analysis.

PlatformIO-based Development: Streamlined build and deployment process for embedded programming.

This code ensures reliable sensor readings and data logging for our L1 rocketâ€™s flight performance.
